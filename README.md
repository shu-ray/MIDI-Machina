# MIDI_Machina
MIDI_Machina is a project featuring several electronic music instruments built with Arduino Mega2560 that made (almost) full use of [MIDI 1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI "Wikipedia - MIDI") features there is to offer, to communicate with [DAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation "Digital Audio Workstation") on general computer and allow the composer to create more opportunities in composing music.    Yet,nothing works for now ;>.
